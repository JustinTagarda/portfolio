## About Me

I am a Full-Stack .NET Developer with 15+ years of experience building and maintaining enterprise web systems, APIs, internal business platforms, and operational tooling.

My work is centered on reliability, clarity, and execution quality: systems that are easy to maintain, perform well under production load, and solve real business problems.
